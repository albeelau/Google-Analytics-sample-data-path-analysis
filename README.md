# Google Analytics Customer Behavious 

Welcome to a journey through the digital corridors of e-commerce, where data speaks volumes about user behavior and insights are the currency of optimization. This project is a testament to my prowess in harnessing the power of Google Analytics and BigQuery to delve into the intricate patterns of customer interactions within a real e-commerce store.

The heartbeat of this analysis is the Google Analytics sample dataset, a treasure trove of information waiting to reveal the most common paths users navigate on the website. By leveraging the robust capabilities of BigQuery, we embark on a quest to unravel the narrative of user journeys â€” from the initial touchpoint to the conversion destination.

My analytical mindset is finely tuned to dissect customer behavior, identify trends, and illuminate the pathways that define their online experience. Through the lens of path analysis, I aim to shed light on user trajectories, uncover potential bottlenecks, and pave the way for strategic optimizations in the user journey.

Join me on this expedition into the digital landscape, where every click, scroll, and interaction tells a story. Let's transform data into actionable insights and elevate the user experience in the world of e-commerce.
