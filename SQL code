1.Most visited pages:

SELECT
  SUBSTRING(hits.page.pagePath, INSTR(hits.page.pagePath, '/', -1) + 1) AS page,
  COUNT(hits.page.pagePath) AS number_of_visits
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`, UNNEST(hits) as hits
WHERE
  _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170731'
GROUP BY page
ORDER BY number_of_visits DESC

2.Bounce rate for each type of page.

WITH bounce_pageviews AS 
(SELECT 
	COUNT(totals.pageviews) AS pageviews, 
	COUNT(totals.bounces) AS bounces,
  hits.page.pagePath AS page,
  ##AVG(totals.timeOnScreen) AS timeOnScreen --There is not any value in "timeOnScreen" column.
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
 ,UNNEST(hits) as hits
WHERE  
   _table_suffix BETWEEN '20160801'AND '20170730'
   AND hits.type = 'PAGE'
GROUP BY page           

SELECT 
    pageviews, 
    page,
    timeOnScreen,
    IFNULL(((bounces / pageviews)*100),0) AS bounce_rate
    FROM bounce_pageviews
GROUP BY pageviews, page, bounces,timeOnScreen
ORDER BY PAGEVIEWS DESC

3.New users and returning users by countries 
SELECT 
	 geoNetwork.country as country,
	 COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN visitNumber = 1 THEN fullvisitorId END) AS new_users ,
	 (COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN visitNumber = 1 THEN fullvisitorId END) / COUNT(DISTINCT fullvisitorId)* 100)  AS new_users_rate,
	 COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN visitNumber > 1 THEN fullvisitorId ELSE NULL END) AS returning_visitors,
	 (COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN visitNumber > 1 THEN fullvisitorId ELSE NULL END) / COUNT(DISTINCT fullvisitorId)*100) AS return_users_rate 	
 
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
WHERE  _table_suffix BETWEEN '20160801'AND '20170730'
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY country DESC
